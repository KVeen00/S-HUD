# S-HUD
Simpli-HUD for DU

Simple general purpose HUD for DU. Currently posted for testing only. Copy entire text and then paste to control unit in game. Menu in upper left will display appropriate cards for installed components. The design intentionally does NOT change vanilla flight controls or modify their behavior with the exception of G including auto-takeoff and land toggle. All other functions are tied to the user option keys Alt-1 through Alt-9 with Alt-# functions changing as the menu pages are changed (Alt-1/2 scroll menus). Connected forcefields will activate on control stop, doors open, and the reverse will occur when started. Connected buttons will activate when started.
